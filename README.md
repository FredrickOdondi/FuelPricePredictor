## Project Overview

The **FuelPricePredictor** is designed to help users predict fuel prices based on various factors such as location, date, and fuel type. The backend uses a machine learning model deployed via an AWS Lambda function to process user inputs and return predictions. The frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the application.

---

## Features

- **Fuel Price Prediction**: Predicts fuel prices based on user-provided inputs.
- **Interactive Frontend**: A responsive and user-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Scalable Backend**: Powered by AWS Lambda, ensuring scalability and cost-effectiveness.
- **Real-Time Results**: Provides real-time predictions with minimal latency.

---

## Architecture

The application follows a serverless architecture:

1. **Frontend**:
   - Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
   - Sends user inputs to the backend via an API Gateway endpoint.

2. **Backend**:
   - An **AWS Lambda function** written in Python processes the inputs.
   - The Lambda function interacts with a pre-trained machine learning model to generate predictions.
   - The results are returned to the frontend via the API Gateway.

3. **Hosting**:
   - Frontend hosted on **Amazon S3** or any static hosting service.
   - Backend deployed on **AWS Lambda** with **API Gateway** for HTTP requests.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript

- **Backend**:
  - Python (AWS Lambda)
  - Machine Learning Model (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)

- **Cloud Services**:
  - AWS Lambda
  - Amazon API Gateway
  - Amazon S3 (for hosting the frontend)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: Required for deploying the Lambda function and API Gateway.
- **Python 3.x**: For local development of the Lambda function.
- **Node.js and npm**: Optional, for managing frontend dependencies.
- **AWS CLI**: Configured with appropriate permissions for deployment.

---

### Backend (AWS Lambda)

1. **Set Up the Lambda Function**:
   - Write the Python code for the Lambda function. Example:
     ```python
     import json

     def lambda_handler(event, context):
         # Extract input from the event
         fuel_type = event['fuel_type']
         location = event['location']
         date = event['date']

         # Perform prediction (example logic)
         prediction = predict_fuel_price(fuel_type, location, date)

         # Return the result
         return {
             'statusCode': 200,
             'body': json.dumps({'predicted_price': prediction})
         }

     def predict_fuel_price(fuel_type, location, date):
         # Replace with actual ML model logic
         return 3.50  # Example prediction
     ```

2. **Deploy the Lambda Function**:
   - Package the Python code and dependencies into a `.zip` file.
   - Upload the `.zip` file to AWS Lambda via the AWS Management Console or CLI.

3. **Set Up API Gateway**:
   - Create an API Gateway endpoint to trigger the Lambda function.
   - Configure the endpoint to accept POST requests with JSON payloads.
